**Overview**
Welcome to the Financial KPI PowerBI Dashboard repository. This project demonstrates the use of Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring and analyzing key financial metrics, specifically focusing on Actual vs Target Sales and variance percentages. 
The dashboard is designed to be highly interactive, allowing users to filter data by teams and gain insights into performance metrics in real-time.

**Features**
Actual vs Target Sales Visualization: Easily compare actual sales figures against target sales goals.
Variance % Calculation: Analyze the percentage variance between actual and target sales to identify performance gaps.
Interactive Filters: Filter data by teams to drill down into specific performance metrics.
Advanced DAX Queries: Utilize advanced DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries for dynamic calculations and data manipulation.
Data Relationships: Establish relationships between multiple tables to ensure accurate data modeling and seamless data integration.

**Advanced Power BI Features Utilized**
Custom DAX Measures: We have created custom DAX measures to calculate variance percentages, aggregate sales data, and perform complex data analysis.
Interactive Visualizations: The dashboard includes various interactive visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and KPI cards to provide a clear and intuitive user experience.
Data Modeling: Leveraged Power BI's data modeling capabilities to create relationships between multiple tables, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
Slicers and Filters: Implemented slicers and filters to allow users to dynamically interact with the data and view specific subsets of information.
Conditional Formatting: Used conditional formatting to highlight key performance indicators, making it easy to spot trends and outliers.
